# LIME - Voxel Renderer

I use this project for experimenting with novel 3D rendering techniques.
The images below are from an older commit which uses per-pixel ray tracing.
More recently, I have refactored the code base with a focus on flexibility.
Triangle models loaded from obj files are now supported, support for voxel
models is being rebuilt. 
My intention is for the new raytracer to work with both voxels and triangles.
